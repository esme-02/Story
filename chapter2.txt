Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall, Humpty Dumpty has a great fall. Threescore men and threescore more, Cannot place Humpty Dumpty as he was before.

- A theory is that Humpty is actually a cannon. During the English Civil War, history says, a one-eyed gunner named Thompson managed to get a cannon – colloquially called ‘Humpty Dumpty’, to the top of the tower of St Mary at the Walls church and wreak untold destruction on the forces below, before return cannon fire dislodged the pair of them. Hence “had a great fall”
